express-app-template
--------------------

Analagous scaffolding to flask-app-template, but for Express JS. Comes with
its own appgen script suited to Express.

Things are set up to use React to render static pages (SSR). Requires the
npm modules in package.json (and their prerequisites) to be present. Also
requires Typescript.

See the README in flask-app-template for more info.
